## Vexxon - The Game

Vexxon is a Zaxxon alike game I write for the Vectrex/PiTrex as part of my [Vectrex newsletter](https://vectrex.substack.com)


## Setup assets folder

The game engine uses several asset files that must be in a folder *{HOME_FOLDER}\vexxon*.
Copy all files from the *assets* folder in the repo to this folder.

**IMPORTANT**: This must be done no matter if you are on Windows, macOS or Linux.


## Windows

I have also created a Windows version so everyone can follow the PiTrex game we create together.

To use **Playground.exe** download **playground_windows.zip** and extract it to a folder.
No further installation is needed.


## macOS

I have also created a macOS version so everyone can follow the PiTrex game we create together.

To use **Playground.app** download **playground_macos.zip** and extract it to a folder.
No further installation is needed.


## Linux

coming soon...
